<h1>Welcome to dotChart<h1>

<p> dotChart is a reusable React component that generates a custom dot chart.
A dot chart is a simple graph that expresses disparate data values. 
The utility of dotChart is in the ability to customize multiple number 
ranges along the Y axis. This is extremely helpful when expressing gross 
value differences. I hope you find dotChart useful! </p>

<h2> Installation </h2>
<p> In your terminal, npm install dotchart </p>
<p> in your text editor, at the top of your file, import{Chart, ChartItem} from "dotChart" </P>
